### Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)

The code in this area is a part of a self-erected study project with Kate Hartman. It also feeds back to some technical requirements for my final thesis work.

The idea is to create a stable network of bluetooth modules that can communicate with each-other over lengthy periods of time.

Three of the modules will have an Arduino Pro Mini, BLE (4.0) module, and a simple sensor. One of the modules will just have a BLE (4.0) module, an Arduino, and act as a receiver plus organizer of the data.

The code here will be largely for the Arduino and should serve as a good basic tutorial for building such a network. 

#### Components

Currently I am using the BLEMINI radios from Red Bear Lab and Arduino Pro Minis running at 3.3 volts.
