This research and exploration project looks at the possibilities within what we wear on the body in our near future. It provides an open set of findings, designs, and physical artifacts that can be iterated on and used by a wider developer community. It is the hope of this project that it will now serve to inspire a leap into the future as visualized by Cyberpunk media, both in style and application. Within Digital Futures the major areas of focus for Periphery have been on the design and scientific research here at OCADU, as well as open artistic exploration.

\section{Possibilities of the prototype}
There are a number of user centric scenarios that can be seen in Periphery as a wearable ambient sensor network.

\mqt{What can be achieved on a small scale?}
\subsection{The personal climate tweaker}\label{subsec:personalclimate}
Anyone can pick up and use the near raw data of periphery now. The main application would be a clear analysis of the overall days and weeks within an individual life. Periphery doesn't carry any location specific data, but what it shows is a consistent time line of sensor events. Taking just the light data as an example, being able to see lighting conditions over time can yield adjustments to the users daily habits and environments. It might be much darker in their place of work then they realize, but by seeing a large light level drop whenever they enter their space they can correlate that lack of light to possible mood drops and difficulties with focus. We tend to not register our surroundings on a minute by minute basis for longer than a few moments, unless something truly extreme is happening at the time. Periphery can provide a window in to the world we forget, and let us tweak our future experiences based on that.

\mqt{What could be an example of a broader project?}
\subsection{Creating a value driven data collection system}
Currently the trend of user generated data is that it is exchanged for a free service. Google provide its search for free in exchange for targeted advertisements and using your habits to rank web pages. Periphery could provide a new set of data that a company like Google would be interested in. This time, though, the user can offer to sell that data to Google, creating incentive to use the system as well as providing a passive source of income to anyone who wishes to participate. Google in turn can use this to calculate more precise weather, visualize the atmosphere of spaces in real time and create a new realm of analytics. 

\newthought{The two ideas} provide a glimpse into what is possible with Periphery, but there are many areas left to be explored. The open nature of the project should be taken as an invitation for that exploration, and as a way to see what can be done with this data and how it can be enhanced.
